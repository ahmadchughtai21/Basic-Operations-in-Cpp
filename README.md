# Simple C++ Arithmetic Operations

This C++ code snippet demonstrates basic arithmetic operations with two integer variables, `A` and `B`.

## Instructions:

1. **Variable Declaration:**
   - Declare integer variables `A` and `B`.

2. **Subtraction Operation:**
   - Subtract 98 from `A` and store the result in `B`.

3. **Increment Operation:**
   - Add 1 to `A` and store the new value back in `A`.

4. **Verification:**
   - Print the values of `A` and `B` to the console.

## Usage:

- Modify the initial value of `A` as needed.
- Compile and run the program to observe the results.
